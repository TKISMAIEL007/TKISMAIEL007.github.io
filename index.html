                />
                <p>After I ruptured my Achilles during the first tournament back with the Springbok Sevens, it felt like the air had been knocked out of my lungs. A wave of disbelief settled in.</p>

                <p>I had just come off a 3-month pre-season. I was the fittest I’d ever been. And after two years of grinding through rehab from a shoulder injury that ended my rugby career, I truly thought I was back.</p>

                <p>Then, just like that, everything changed.</p>

                <p>When life strips away everything you’ve fought so hard to reclaim, you’re forced to ask:</p>

                <p>What’s left when everything stops?</p>

                <p>For me, what remained were a few core principles. Not motivational quotes or silver linings but habits and truths I could hold onto when nothing else made sense. I now call them my <strong>Resilience Toolkit</strong>. And whether you're coming back from an injury, a business failure, or a life curveball, I hope something here helps you too.</p>

                

                <p><strong>1. Discipline > Motivation</strong></p>
                <p>When your body is broken and your spirit is drained, motivation disappears.</p>
                <p>But discipline. Showing up, doing what matters, even in small ways, becomes the anchor.</p>
                <p>There were mornings I didn’t want to get out of bed. Days where the progress felt invisible, even pointless. But sticking to my rehab schedule, writing (which became the foundation for this blog), and even just showing up for my family taught me this:</p>
                <p>builds momentum, even when results don’t show.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Curate Your Environment</strong></p>
                <p>Resilience doesn’t just come from within, it’s shaped by what surrounds you.</p>
                <p>I became intentional about what I consumed: less noise, more signal, better quality.</p>
                <p>I cleaned up my social feeds, reconnected with uplifting voices, and created a space that reminded me of who I was becoming.</p>
                <p>Your environment either feeds your strength or drains it.</p>
                <p>Build one that backs your growth.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Let People In</strong></p>
                <p>As an athlete, you’re taught to push through, to tough it out. But isolation is the enemy of resilience.</p>
                <p>This time, I allowed myself to be supported. By my wife, my family, my mentors. I had honest conversations, accepted help, and let myself be seen.</p>
                <p>Resilience isn’t about doing it alone.</p> 
                <p>It’s about healing in community.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Rebuild the Identity First</strong></p>
                <p>What makes injury or failure hard isn’t just the physical loss, it’s the identity crisis.</p>
                <p>Who are you without the game? The job? The title?</p>
                <p>The turning point came when I started asking: Who do I want to become next?</p>
                <p>That question helped me move forward with purpose, not just recovery. It’s what led me to entrepreneurship, to writing, and to this journey I’m now on.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Zoom Out Often</strong></p>
                <p>Pain pulls you into the now. It makes your world feel small.</p>
                <p>What helped was learning to zoom out, to see this setback as part of a bigger picture.</p>
                <p>That didn’t mean pretending it didn’t hurt. But it reminded me that this was a chapter, not the whole story. And some of the most meaningful chapters are written in silence, without applause.</p>

               

                <p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
                <p>Setbacks test more than your body, they test your belief.</p>
                <p>And real resilience is built long before the comeback is visible.</p>
                <p>If you're going through your own rebuilding season, I hope you know this:</p>

                <blockquote>You're not starting from scratch. You're starting from strength.</blockquote>

                />
                <p>In professional sport we have the advantage of getting instant feedback. As an individual on the field you immediately know whether you had a positive or negative action by the reactions of the crowd, applause echoing around the stands. On the other hand, the score board is an easy indicator of whether your teams plans or strategies worked or not. So, you see, there is that constant feedback loop.</p>
                <p>When I stepped away from the game into corporate and entrepreneurship that instant feedback loop was no longer there. Things went quiet.</p>

                <p>No match day, no jersey to put on and no fans cheering. Just early mornings, a whole lot of unanswered emails and late nights working and figuring things out. It’s in this time when nobody’s watching that the self-doubt creeps in.</p>

                <p>There is a shift that no one talks about. In rugby, I know my role. I know exactly how to prepare for a match; I know the structure. </p>

                <p>But starting something new. Building from scratch was a whole new game for me. It felt like being in rehab all over again. Learning to make small basic movements and hoping they’d add up. No applause for showing up. No one clapping when I signed my first small client. No one watching when I stayed up late fixing things I barely understood.</p>
                <p>That was hard. </p>
                <p>But that is also where the real growth started.</p>
                <p>What rugby taught me and what I had to hold on to is this:</p>
                <p>The reps or work that matters most are the ones that no one sees.</p>

                <p>The belief that matters most is the belief you have in yourself. The belief that doesn’t need applause, that doesn’t need external validation.</p>

                <p>The habits that matter most are the ones that even though they feel boring builds something real over time.</p>
                <p>Whether it’s in the gym, doing recovery or showing up for rehab, the mindset is the same in business: You show up. Even when its quiet. Especially when its quiet.</p>
                <p>So why am I sharing this? Because I know what it’s like to feel unseen. To pour your effort into something new and wonder if it’s even working. If you’ve left a title, a team or identity behind and you’re starting over… I see you.</p>
                <p>Keep showing up. Even if it feels small now, you're building something that matters.</p>

                />
                <p>When I first had to stop playing professional rugby I didn’t know where to start or what I will be doing next. So, I started with the one thing I knew – Rugby. I ended up coaching part time and I must admit it was something I enjoyed. I always figured I would give back in one way or another when I am done playing. I was still searching though.</p>
                <p>I longed for something different, something that will have impact, something other than rugby. My first step forward?  Transport and logistics, not by design, purely by chance. It wasn’t glamorous, but honestly, it grounded me. It gave me direction when I needed it most.</p>

                <p> What did Rugby Really Teach Me…</p>

                <p>Looking back, rugby didn’t just teach me how to perform — it taught me how to live.</p>

                <p>- Game plans became business strategies</p>
                <p>- Opponents became competitors</p>
                <p>- Coaches became mentors</p>
                <p>- Physical endurance became mental resilience</p>
                <p>It all transferred — just in ways I didn’t expect.</p>

                <p>Once again, I was in the Deep End</p>

                <p>I didn’t go into Logistics because I was passionate about it. I went into it because I was searching, looking for ways and opportunities to expand my knowledge base and expertise. Looking for different systems to explore and learn. </p>
                <p>I didn’t know anything about transport; it was all new and I had to learn quickly. Handling different tasks, I was managing deliveries, figuring out systems, handling clients — most days felt like I was scrambling.</p>
                <p>But I’d been here before. On the field, under pressure, learning fast. That muscle memory kicked in. The mindset from sport carried me through the early chaos.</p>
                <p>Now, I am Rewriting My Story</p>
                <p>These days, I spend most of my time in business development and marketing — helping build brands, drive growth, and most importantly – helping people connect. It’s a different game, but the same principles apply, preparation, execution, trust.</p>
                <p>The biggest shift? I’ve gone from chasing personal performance to building something bigger — a career, a brand, a legacy.</p>

                <p>What’s Stuck with Me</p>

                <p> - Stay humble: You’re never too experienced to start at the bottom again.</p>
                <p> - Discipline wins: My habits on the field became my anchor in business.</p>
                <p> - Identity can evolve: You’re not limited to who you were — you can become more.</p>

                <p>Honestly</p>

                <p>I didn’t plan or want to leave rugby when I did - but life has a way of redirecting us when we least expect it.</p>
                <p>Now, I’m learning to tap into that past to guide me in building what’s next. It’s not perfect. I’m still figuring things out. But if you’re reading this and you’ve had to start over, I want you to know this:</p>
                <p>Starting over isn’t failure. It’s a chance to discover your purpose and build with more intention.</p>
                <p>And that, to me, is a win.</p>

                <h2>The Slipstream Principle</h2> <!--Post Title comes here-->
                <p class="post-meta">Published July 14 2025</p><!--Plublishing date comes here(Exmaople: Published on July 8,2025)-->

                />
                <p>“A slipstream is a region of lower pressure that forms behind a moving object, like a car, aircraft, or even cyclist.” By riding in the slipstream, cyclists or cars can reduce the force of aerodynamic drag, making it easier to move and potentially increasing speed.</p>
                <p>Having been living a life of sport for as long as I can remember it has been the guiding light for me when it comes to dealing with life and its challenges. Over the years I have had to deal with many challenges in sport and in life. Through sport I’ve had the opportunity to deal with great success and massive failure and all within a short time frame, one day you can be up in the clouds and a few days later down in the gutters. I’ve had to learn how to deal with these massive emotional and mental rollercoasters on a frequent basis. Again, it was within sport that I found many of my answers and developed principles that guided me. </p>
                <p>We all have dreams and aspirations, if not, we wouldn’t be able to get ourselves out of bed in the morning. The thing with dreams is, they rarely fall into your lap. It takes extreme discipline and perseverance to chase your dreams. So, what happens when you have been doing the work, putting in the hours, operating under enormous amounts of pressure and yet you still no closer to reaching your goal? We end up losing hope, our drive starts diminishing and our cadence declines. Why does this happen? One major reason is because we have been the "lead rider" in a solo race trying to do it all ourselves without even realising it. It was through experiencing rollercoasters like this that I unconsciously found myself applying what I now refer to as the “Slipstream Principle” in all areas of my life.</p>
                <p>Let me explain how it works.</p>

                <p>1.	Find someone who resembles who you want to be or has the career you want to have or the body you wish to have - you get the point.</p>
                <p>2.	Think of a way you can assist them in achieving what they want.</p>
                <p>3.	Convince them to allow you to help them.</p>
                <p>4.	Let them take charge and guide you (let them be “lead rider’’)</p>
                <p>5.	Learn as much as you can as fast as you can (Ride the slipstream)</p>

                <p>By applying these principles, you relieve enormous amounts of pressure from yourself. You mitigate unnecessary costly errors (there will always be errors) and you are forced to operate at a higher cadence, only this time having to exert less energy. Your “lead rider” will be absorbing most of the drag for you and you will likely get valuable exercise in taking the lead by relieving your “lead rider” from time to time, only this time when your cadence starts to drop your “lead rider” will be there to take the lead and push the pace once again. Using this principle with the consent and co-operation of your fellow rider/partner is a sure way of strengthening your resolve, increasing your endurance and getting both of you to your objectives much quicker. Make no mistake, this is not a free ride. To stay in the slipstream, you will need to keep up with the pace and stay close enough, because if the gap gets too big you will be left fighting the drag and surely be left behind.</p>
                <p>So, ask yourself this question, are you currently a “lead rider” or do you need to slide into a slipstream?</p>

                <p>One of my favourite concepts in life is a Japanese proverb called Wabi – Sabi which simply means “beauty in imperfection.”</p>
                <p>In life we are indoctrinated to believe if we are not perfect then we are not enough. If we do not fit into a system, then we do not fit into society. We spend our entire life fighting and striving to fit in and through that find a sense of belonging. How then do we grow, how do we learn and how do we become?</p>
                <p>You see, growth does not lie in always trying to be perfect. The mere aspiration of trying to be perfect unintentionally eliminates countless opportunities and possibilities that cannot be considered unless it will turn out to be perfect.</p>
                <p>Consider this. What if you attempted everything you ever dreamed of without attaching a certain result to it. What if you fail while colouring outside the lines as well as inside.</p>
                <p>What if you dare to break everything down then try and glue it back together and in the process stumble upon perfection. Isn’t that the point of living.</p>
