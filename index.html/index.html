                <p>One of my favourite concepts in life is a Japanese proverb called Wabi – Sabi which simply means “beauty in imperfection.”</p>
                <p>In life we are indoctrinated to believe if we are not perfect then we are not enough. If we do not fit into a system, then we do not fit into society. We spend our entire life fighting and striving to fit in and through that find a sense of belonging. How then do we grow, how do we learn and how do we become?</p>
                <p>You see, growth does not lie in always trying to be perfect. The mere aspiration of trying to be perfect unintentionally eliminates countless opportunities and possibilities that cannot be considered unless it will turn out to be perfect.</p>
                <p>Consider this. What if you attempted everything you ever dreamed of without attaching a certain result to it. What if you fail while colouring outside the lines as well as inside.</p>
                <p>What if you dare to break everything down then try and glue it back together and in the process stumble upon perfection. Isn’t that the point of living.</p>
