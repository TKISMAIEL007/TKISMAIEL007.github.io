    "content": "In professional cycling, slipstreaming is the art of riding close behind another cyclist to reduce wind resistance. It’s a strategy used to conserve energy and maintain speed. Life works the same way.\n\nWhen you find someone ahead of you — in business, in healing, in purpose — you can learn from their momentum while finding your own rhythm. This isn’t copying; it’s strategic alignment.\n\nSometimes the best move isn’t to forge a new lane, but to ride in the stream of someone who’s been there. When the time is right, you pull ahead — not because you stole speed, but because you studied how to sustain it."

    "content": "Becoming isn’t a destination. It’s a decision you make every day.\n\nFrom Belhar to the Bulls, from injury to reinvention — I’ve learned that who you’re becoming is more important than what you’ve been. Titles fade, but your values carry you forward.\n\nWhether I’m building a brand, mentoring young athletes, or showing up for my family — the goal is the same: show up real. Show up ready. And never stop becoming."
