    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Travis Ismaiel</strong> â€” a former professional rugby player turned purpose-driven entrepreneur, husband, and father of three.</p>

    <p>In 2020, an injury forced me to hang up my boots after more than a decade in the game. I had just completed an intense pre-season with the Springbok Sevens squad and was in the best shape of my life. Then, during the first tournament back, I ruptured my Achilles. That was the second major setback after a career-ending shoulder injury that had already sidelined me for two years.</p>

    <p>These experiences didnâ€™t just reshape my body â€” they reshaped my life.  
    They taught me that even when the crowd is gone, and the title no longer fits, I still have something valuable to offer.</p>

    <p>Today, I use those lessons to build. To lead. To serve.</p>

    <h3>What Iâ€™m Doing Now:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Co-Founder of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thesocialhubmedia" target="_blank">The Social Hub Media</a></strong> â€“ A purpose-led PR & Events agency helping brands tell their stories, spark conversation, and host premium experiences.</li>
      <li><strong>Sales & Client Lead at Siyabonwa Logistix</strong> â€“ A logistics company focused on integrity, reliability, and delivering goods across South Africa and beyond.</li>
      <li><strong>Writer & Speaker</strong> â€“ Through my blog and talks, I share stories and strategies for navigating transitions, building resilience, and creating a life beyond the game.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This site is my personal playground for writing, reflection, and connecting with others who are navigating their own transitions.</p>

    <p>If youâ€™re a fellow entrepreneur, creative, leader, or builder â€” welcome.  
    Letâ€™s build something meaningful.</p>
