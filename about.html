    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I’m Travis — People know me as a former professional rugby player.</p>

    <p>Those close to me know me as a thinker and someone who believes in the power of showing up. I created this space to share stories, insights, and lessons drawn from real, lived experiences. Also, I enjoy writting.</p>

    
    <p>This blog isn’t about perfection. It’s about presence. It’s a place to reflect on growth, courage, vulnerability, and the everyday moments that shape who we are. Whether it's a breakthrough or a breakdown, every experience teaches us something valuable.</p>
    
    <p>My hope is that by sharing my journey, I can inspire you to lean into yours — with honesty, heart, and a little humor.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks for being here.</p>
